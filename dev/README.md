# dev Folder

This folder meant for devlopment of the code on my personal github, and
changes will only be pulled to MEMG/optode-response-time when they are ready
for general use.

If you are a user that has found their way to this page you are welcome to
access and use any of the code here, but there is a good chance that it won't
work properly, error out, or worse will run but give you the wrong results!

## Current development

Right now I am working on re-running the results from 
_[Gordon et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2020-119)_, and repeating
the analysis using density as the default depth index rather than pressure. 

## changelog

May 5, 2020: created this folder and started on script to re-run optimization
